					  2. humans, underground tunnel, stealth can be used, millitary patrol
					  3. air ducts, easyest way, but difficult to find, one high level zombie guarding entrance
4. master key need to enter villan's lab(objective), on entering lab villan releases a mega zombie, at the end zombie kills the villan.
5. heath kits will take 10 sec to apply and player will not be able to move, unlimited heath kits and food items
6. Zombie's spotting dia will increase at night and players visibilty will be lowered.
